# calculator

Description:
- I built this calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I mainly built this project to practice JavaScript. 

Deployment:
- https://clintrizzo.github.io/calculator/

future:
- My plan for this projct is to allow the user to be able to use the keyboard to input. I would also like to create more of a scientific calculator for future use.
